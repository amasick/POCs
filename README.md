RAAS: Agentic RAG Chatbot
Task 1: Requirement Gathering & Architecture Design

Design end-to-end architecture integrating RAG pipeline, agentic reasoning, and context layer.

Finalize integration points with Confluence, GitHub, and internal documentation systems.

Task 2: Data Integration & Preparation

Collect and preprocess data from selected sources (HTML, Markdown, PDF, README files).

Generate embeddings and index them in a vector database (FAISS/Chroma).

Task 3: RAG Pipeline Development

Implement retrieval system for document search using vector similarity.

Add contextual summarization and ranking to improve response accuracy.

Task 4: Agentic Layer & Orchestration

Build multi-agent framework for dynamic query handling, reasoning, and memory management.

Implement task routing, self-correction, and tool selection via Google ADK or LangGraph.

Task 5: Backend & Frontend Integration

Develop FastAPI backend endpoints for context retrieval and LLM interaction.

Create Streamlit-based UI for developers to query, visualize, and validate results.

Task 6: Testing & Evaluation

Evaluate chatbot responses on accuracy, latency, and contextual relevance metrics.

Conduct Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) validation for uncertain or low-confidence outputs.

Task 7: Deployment & Documentation

Containerize all modules (API + UI) using Docker for consistent deployment.

Document architecture, APIs, evaluation methods, and performance benchmarks.


üõ°Ô∏è SCA Agentic Automation 
Task 1: Problem Definition & Scope Alignment

Define automation goals and measurable success criteria for vulnerability management.

Identify integration scope with scanning, tracking, and version control systems.

Task 2: Data Ingestion & Parsing Setup

Establish data pipeline for ingesting and processing scan reports.

Extract and classify vulnerabilities based on severity and category.

Task 3: Agent Architecture & Design

Design the agentic workflow including planning, reasoning, and execution layers.

Define interaction logic and communication flow between core components.

Task 4: Integration Development

Implement system integrations for data exchange and workflow automation.

Enable synchronization across all tools and data sources involved in the remediation process.

Task 5: Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) Feedback System

Build review interface for validation and approval of automated recommendations.

Capture feedback data to continuously refine agent decisions and actions.

Task 6: Testing, Simulation & Validation

Conduct simulations on multiple report scenarios to validate accuracy and consistency.

Verify reliability of workflows under different data and approval conditions.

Task 7: Evaluation & Reporting

Measure performance against defined KPIs and improvement metrics.

Prepare final outcome report and summarize key learnings for stakeholders.
